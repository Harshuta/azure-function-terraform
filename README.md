This task involves creating and deploying an Azure Function App using Terraform to provision the required Azure resources in an automated and consistent manner. The deployment includes defining the Function App, its supporting resources (Resource Group, Storage Account, App Service Plan/Consumption Plan), and configuring environment settings through Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC). By using Terraform, the Azure Function can be deployed repeatedly across environments with version-controlled configurations, ensuring scalability, reliability, and simplified infrastructure management.
